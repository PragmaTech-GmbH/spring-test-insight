# Release Workflow Evolution

## Current Workflow (Using Official JReleaser Action)

```yaml
name: Release
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      version:
        description: 'Release version (e.g., 1.0.0)'
        required: true
        type: string

jobs:
  release:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: write
      packages: write
      
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0
          
      - name: Set up Java
        uses: actions/setup-java@v4
        with:
          java-version: '21'
          distribution: 'temurin'
          
      - name: Build with Maven
        working-directory: spring-test-insight-extension
        run: ./mvnw -Prelease verify
        
      - name: Run JReleaser
        uses: jreleaser/release-action@v2
        with:
          arguments: full-release
          version: 1.14.0
          working-directory: spring-test-insight-extension
        env:
          JRELEASER_PROJECT_VERSION: ${{ github.event.inputs.version }}
          JRELEASER_GITHUB_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
          # ... other secrets
          
      - name: Upload JReleaser logs
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        if: always()
        with:
          name: jreleaser-logs
          path: |
            spring-test-insight-extension/out/jreleaser/trace.log
            spring-test-insight-extension/out/jreleaser/output.properties
```

## Key Improvements

### ✅ Simplified Workflow
- **Before**: ~100 lines with manual version management, Git operations, staging
- **After**: ~60 lines using official action

### ✅ Better Maintainability
