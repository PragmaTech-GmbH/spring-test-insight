# Spring Test Insight

A JUnit Jupiter extension that provides visualization and insights for Spring Test execution, with a focus on Spring context caching statistics.

## Features

- Visualize test results in a clean HTML report
- Track Spring Test context caching statistics
- Show context reuse metrics and cache hit/miss ratios
- Identify tests that couldn't reuse contexts and explain why
- Support for Spring 6+ and Java 21+
- Easy integration via `@ExtendWith` or automatic service loader activation
- Works with both Maven Surefire/Failsafe and Gradle test tasks

## Usage

### Quick Start

Add the dependency to your project:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>digital.pragmatech</groupId>
    <artifactId>spring-test-insight-extension</artifactId>
    <version>1.0.0</version>
    <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

### Automatic Activation (Recommended)

The extension automatically activates for all tests via service loader. No additional configuration needed.

### Manual Activation

Alternatively, add the extension to specific test classes:

```java
@ExtendWith(SpringTestInsightExtension.class)
@SpringBootTest
class MySpringTest {
    // Your tests here
}
```

### Running Tests

Execute your tests normally:

```bash
# Maven
mvn test

# Gradle
./gradlew test
```

### Viewing Reports

After test execution, find the HTML report at:
- Maven: `target/spring-test-insight/latest.html`
- Gradle: `build/spring-test-insight/latest.html`

### Demo Project

See the `demo` directory for a complete Spring Boot example showcasing the extension.

```bash
# Run the demo
cd demo
mvn clean test
# Open target/spring-test-insight/latest.html
```
